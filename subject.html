      <h2> Udyr </h2>
          <p> One of the easiest jglers with only autoattacks, Udyr clears extremely fast while having decent gank setup with the movement speed from bear stance and passive. The build can be found <a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/udyr/build"> here </a> </p>
      <h2> Hecarim </h2>
		  <p> This champion deals great damage while being tanky from Steraks and death dance and his ult is a amazing engage tool with fears. The build can be found <a href ="https://u.gg/lol/champions/hecarim/build"> here </a> </p>
      <h2> Khazix </h2>
		  <p> The best ad assasin Khazix can one shot a carry while escaping with either duskblade, upgraded leap or void assasult. His slipperiness and massive damage is what makes him so good. The build can found here <a href ="https://u.gg/lol/champions/khazix/build"> here </a> </p>
      <h2> Evelynn </h2>
		  <p> Evelynn has massive bursts which can easily one shot an adc with ult and if she's ahead she can one shot anyone. The build can be found <a href="https://u.gg/lol/champions/evelynn/build"> here </a> </p>
